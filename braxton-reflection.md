1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I wasn't fully understanding the need for `git fetch` and `git merge` and why we use it over `git pull`. Iulia helped to clear it up tremendously!
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Iulia helped to clarify `git merge` and `git fetch` and also how you need to checkout the `master` before typing both of these in. 
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Asked for some time to illustrate the Sublime conflicts she was talking about that could happen when two branches have the same file open, but each have different versions of its content. 
4. What still confuses you about git?
No confusion, just gotta learn to take this from practicing git to feeling automatic with it. :) 

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Excellent! I didn't have a pair, but Iulia made it very enjoyable.
